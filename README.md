This plugin shows on the Grand Staff what MIDI notes are being played at each time. It will also display chord names if a matching chord type is found.

A special acknowledgement must be made to Diego Merino, who had the original idea and has been helping me to refine this work. He also created many of the graphics used here.

Another must mention, is that the chord recognition algorithm is based on the Chordback JSFX script written by Paul Heams. He can be contacted on X (Twitter) as @17BitRetro
